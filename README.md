> Simple Reusable Vanilla Contracts for [Scilla](https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla)

 <br>

Vanilla is a library for smart contract development in Scilla . It provides implementations of various Scilla contracts which you can deploy as-is or you can extend to suit your needs. Common contracts used for example, fungible token , crowdsale (with various variations) , RANDAO etc are openly available to developers and can be used for production. However, we take no responsibility for your implementation or any security problems you might encounter.

Feel free to create requests for smart contracts you would like to see developed by merkalise by opening an issue.

## Running Scilla contracts :running: 
1. Install Scilla binary here: https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla.
2. Use the easyrun script to run the test suites for each contract.
   ```
   ./easyrun.sh ERC223 1
   ```
